## Past lab meetings

| Date | Speaker | Topic |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 12/08/17 | MH Tessler | politeness and indirect speech |
| 12/15/17 | Reuben Cohn-Gordon | models of higher-order indexicality |


## Future lab meetings

- RSA tutorial(s)

- Sunwoo Jeong -- politeness effects of English rising declaratives

- Judith Degen -- QUD analysis of interpretation of "Black lives matter"

- Chantal Gratton?

- Robert Xu? 


## Project ideas 

- cross-linguistic politeness project: do cookies rating experiments from Yoon et al 2016/2017 with different groups of speakers (Japanese, German, Romanian) -- do inferred weights on social goal differ? Does ordering generalize to other tasks? --> quantification of potential cross-linguistic/cross-cultural differences in (at least one dimension of) politeness

- Can we model Robert's and Katherine's "stereotypical character" speech datasets with RSA?

## High-level issues

- What is the distinction between meanings that should be made, if any (given that they appear to be dependent on each other at least sometimes, eg in the polite cookies case)?

	- epistemic / social?

	- indexical / truth-conditional?

- How much strategic control is there over how speakers express variables? (Is this a well-formed question?)
